# Hello, I'm Felipe Isaac!

I study civil engineering @ Universidade Federal da Bahia - UFBA :construction_worker:

I am studying to be a fullstack developer @ [Cubos Academy](https://cubos.io/#academy) :computer:

I listen to music all day long:saxophone:, I read books all night long:books:, sometimes I try to write poetry. I also like math, history, travel and cooking (better at it than at writing poetry, but it is not that hard).
