# Hello, I'm Felipe Isaac!

:construction_worker: I study civil engineering @ Universidade Federal da Bahia - UFBA

:computer: I am studying to be a fullstack developer @ [Cubos Academy](https://cubos.io/#academy)

I **love** music:saxophone:, I **love** literature:books:, I love poetry, movies, series, anything that is related to any kind of art, and because of that my friends always ask me why did I choose to study engineering __(still do not know the answer, but I love it too)__
