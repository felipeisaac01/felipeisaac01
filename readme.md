# Hello, I'm Felipe Isaac!

I study civil engineering @ Universidade Federal da Bahia - UFBA

I am studying to be a fullstack developer @ @Cubos academy

I **love** music, I **love** literature, I love poetry, movies, series, anything that is related to any kind of art, and because of that my friends always ask me why did I choose to study engineering __(still do not know the answer, but I love it too)__
